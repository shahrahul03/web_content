      <h1>Mathematics and Numeracy</h1>

      <h2>Importance</h2>
      <p>
        Mathematics and numeracy encourage creativity through problem-solving
        and exploring patterns, structures and relationships. Activities like
        counting and sorting encourage logical thinking, while things like
        shaping encourage imaginative thinking. It promotes experimentation with
        number and shapes in early childhood. This space allows different ways
        of working, producing unique solutions to a math task. Kids create games
        or designs which build their confidence. This preparation lays down a
        foundation for analytical and creative skills for further education.
      </p>

      <h2>Creativity Theories</h2>
      <p>
        Creativity in mathematics can grow by playing with other people’s
        materials. Kids develop creativity through making counting games and
        matching their age. It presents different methods children use to solve
        mathematical problems. In early education, doing pattern making and
        open-ended activities encourages divergent thinking. This approach
        develops the learner’s creative growth and the logic involved in math.
      </p>

      <h2>Resources and Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        Using counting blocks, shape puzzles and number cards in school. Beads
        and strings help create patterns. Tablets with apps like "Number Fun"
        teach math games. Interactive whiteboards show counting songs. Audio of
        number rhymes adds fun. Craft supplies like clay form shapes. Video
        tools record math projects. With teacher support, they provide hands-on
        ways to experience creativity through maths and tech.
      </p>

      <h2>Learning Experiences</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>0-2 Years:</strong><br />
          Block Stack: Stack blocks and say each one out loud (Zhang, 2021).<br />
          Shape Touch: With support, feel and name simple shapes (Zhang, 2021,
          pp. 2,3).
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>2-3 Years:</strong><br />
          Pattern Play: Take the colored blocks and arrange them in a pattern
          (Kiewra, 2016).<br />
          Count Toys: Number the toys while you put them away.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>3-5 Years:</strong><br />
          Shape Art: Let kids make pictures using shape blocks.<br />
          Number Game: Use the die and count the spaces to move.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>6-8 Years:</strong><br />
          Math Puzzle: Work out a number puzzle (An, 2012).<br />
          Graph Fun: Create a graph of our favorite colors (An, 2012, p. 53).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Critical Analysis: Mathematics & Numeracy</h2>
      <p>
        Block Stack for 0–2 years encouraged counting and fine motor skills, and
        many infants repeated the activity without prompting. Some became
        distracted after the tower fell; introducing soft music or a counting
        song could re-engage them. Shape Art for 3–5 years allowed for creative
        exploration of geometry. While most children embraced the challenge, a
        few had difficulty placing smaller shapes—providing larger or
        self-adhesive shapes could assist. Both activities blended creativity
        with mathematical thinking, with opportunities for more adaptive
        materials to support all learners.
